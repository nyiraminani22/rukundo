                <hr width="200px"height="10%">
                <p>A unique English-language institution, RICA combines research, education, and extension services to<br> train Rwanda’s
                     next generation of leaders in agriculture, while supporting national priorities for<br> agricultural development.<br><br>

                    RICA students will learn the principles of Conservation Agriculture and One Health, with an emphasis on<br> building 
                    communication, leadership, and entrepreneurship skills. Students will gain hands-on experience<br> in smallholder farming, 
                    while also being exposed to six different enterprise-scale agribusinesses during <br>their course of study. They will also
                     engage closely with local farming communities through on-site <br>extension education and through the NASHO Irrigation 
                     Cooperative to ensure research insights are<br> informed by local needs and knowledge is transferred to benefit local<br> 
                     communities.

                    <h1>RICA’s ORIGIN</h1>
                    <hr width="200px"height="10%">
                    <p>
                        RICA’s story begins with a farmer-philanthropist’s vision. Howard G. Buffett’s commitment to support<br> Rwanda’s 
                        development spans two decades and investments of more than USD$250M since 2000, part of<br> more than USD$650 million 
                        in development investments he has made across the African continent, mostly<br> in smallholder agriculture.<br><br>

                        Howard has for many years articulated a vision for how best to address the profound challenges most<br> smallholder 
                        farmers face in sub-Saharan Africa that include poor and degraded soils; lack of technical<br> knowledge and expertise;
                         little access to inputs and equipment; limited research relevant to their specific <br>soil, disease and pest issues. 
                         The “crazy idea that no one would be willing to fund,” as he called it, was<br> based on an approach that revolutionized 
                         agriculture in the United States beginning in the 1850s. Howard<br> wanted to build a context-appropriate, “land-grant” 
                         institution in partnership with a government in Africa<br> that would combine a practical, training-based education with 
                         localized, applied research that was<br> informed through extension. He believed the Government of Rwanda, under President
                          Kagame’s strong <br>leadership, with its robust institutions and commitment to development, combined with the country’s <br>
                          unique agricultural challenges of limited land and “a thousand hills,” would be the best partner in this<br>
                           endeavor. <br><br>    </p>
                          <img src="ri3.jpg" width="85%">
                          <p>From there, in close collaboration with the Government of Rwanda, Howard’s vision for RICA took shape<br>
                             to form <i>a mission built around conservation agriculture; smallholder-led ag development; 
                                 and youth leadership.</i><br><br>
                             

As a farmer, Howard believes that modern farming in a world constrained by resources and extreme <br>weather variability 
means going back to basics. At the heart of RICA is a belief that the future of farming <br>around the world must be conservation-based 
and soil health-focused. Technology cannot revive dead soil;<br> there are many problems that only nature can solve.<br><br>

Howard also believes that agricultural development in countries like Rwanda must be led by smallholders.<br> Rwanda cannot
 support large-scale urbanization, so farmers must become more self-reliant and profitable<br> to continue to play an important
  role in Rwanda’s future. Solving the challenges smallholders face is<br> central to RICA’s mission.<br><br>

Farming around the world also has an aging problem. Engaging young people in agriculture is critical to<br> transforming the 
sector. RICA’s focus on entrepreneurship, innovation, leadership and communications is<br> by design. RICA seeks to attract
 Rwanda’s best and brightest so that they can be part of the future of <br>agriculture at all scales: from smallholder farming 
 to value-added processing.<br><br>

                            <p>
                                With these core tenets in place, in 2017 the Howard G. Buffett Foundation committed USD$125M to build<br>
                                 RICA’s campus and to provide financial support for its initial operations. The Government of Rwanda in <br>
                                 turn provided RICA with the land and ministerial support to develop this unique, world-class institution<br><br>

RICA began because of the ambitious vision of one farmer-philanthropist. It exists today because of Howard’s unwavering financial support 
and the strong partnership of a visionary Government of Rwanda<br>. RICA’s ultimate challenge remains: to seed innovations in agriculture that 
empower smallholder <br>development and agribusiness to maximize the potential for food produced by Rwandans for Rwandans.<br><br>

                            <h1>Nasho: OUR EXTENSION PARTNER.</h1>
                           <p> The NASHO Irrigation Cooperative (NAICO) is a revolutionary effort to put smallholder farmers at <br>the center of solutions to improve 
                            food security in Rwanda. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation is partnering<br> with the Government of Rwanda and 2,000 smallholder farming 
                            families to support the increased<br> production of 1,173 hectares (2,899 acres) in the drought-prone region of Rwanda’s Eastern Province.
                             Since<br> 2016, the Foundation has invested over USD$50M for the commissioning of 63 
                            center pivot irrigation systems,<br> each providing irrigation for as many as 96 smallholder farms, with most averaging 40<br> 
                            smallholder farms.<br><br></p>

                          <p>NAICO will serve as the primary extension services program for area smallholder farmers to see
                               first-hand the <br>improved practices and context-relevant approaches to improving smallholder productivity.
                                NAICO also showcases<br> the potential for irrigation, the introduction of mechanization, and seed multiplication.
                                 RICA students in turn will<br> benefit from a real-world scale demonstration of the problems 
                              smallholder farmers face and the challenges of extending<br> solutions and new ideas to the field.<br><br></p>

                              <p>Before the plan for RICA was even finalized, Howard G. Buffett made an early big bet on Rwanda’s future leaders<br>
                                   in agriculture. In 2015, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation made a USD$47.5M investment to launch the CUSP program,<br>
                                    which funds full undergraduate scholarships for 200 Rwandan students to study conservation-based agriculture at<br> 
                                    the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).  CUSP Scholars graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in Integrated<br>
                                     Science and are required to return to Rwanda for at least five years after they graduate to pursue jobs in the <br>
                                     agriculture sector, with many slated to join RICA’s faculty and staff.<br><br>

                                Beyond administering the CUSP Scholars program, UNL also serves as a thought and implementation partner at<br> RICA on operations
                                 and curriculum design.<br><br>
